## How to use Lucky Post

There are two ways to use Lucky Post and some rules to follow to ensure it works.

### Method 1: href link

Perhaps the simplest method is to link your href (url) to 'https://example.com/rdm-post/'
- https://example.com being your own website URL
- /rdm-post/ being the trigger

Important notes:
- It's important to keep the forward-slash '/' at the beginning and end of 'rdm-post' along with the full url. Otherwise the trigger will not function.
**Correct** usage example:
```html
<a href="https://example.com/rdm-post/">Random Post</a>
```
**Inccorect** usage:
```html
<a href="/rdm-post">Random Post</a>
```

### Method 2: classname

Sometimes we may have elements without a href (url) link anchored. In these instances we can use the classname **btn-random**

E.g.
```html
<button class="btn-random">Get random post</button>
```

### How do I add Lucky Post to my navigation?

Navigate to **Settings > Navigation** and create a new link with your website URL followed by '/rdm-post/'

E.g. `https://example.com/rdm-post/`
